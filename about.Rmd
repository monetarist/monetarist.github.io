My hobby is reading books! 'Why Nations Fail' & 'A Random Walk Down Wall Street' were one of the best books I've ever read. I strongly recommend these books. I've decided to major in Economics after I read 'Why Nations Fail' & I got interested in investing by reading 'A Random Walk Down Wall Street'. If anyone wants to have a comfortable retirement, I highly recommend this book.My favorite PodCast is Dan Carlin's Hard Core History because I love history!
