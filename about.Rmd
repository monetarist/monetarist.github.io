## This is me

Hi, My name is Yeongjun Oh, and this is my website.
I majored in Economics at Rutgers University, along with a minor in Math. I'm an undergraduate member of ODE - the International Economics Honor Society - and the Rutgers Economics Society. My passion is data analytics and data forecasting, which enables me to solve real-world problems with data science. I believe that data science helps understand each other, bringing positive change to the real world. I am proficient in R (this website is one example of my capabilities in R), Python, PostgreSQL, Google Sheets (Google Apps Script, Pivot table, V-lookup), Excel (VBA, Pivot table, V-lookup), and Javascript.

My hobby is reading books! 'Why Nations Fail' & 'A Random Walk Down Wall Street' were one of the best books I've ever read and I strongly recommend these books. I've decided to major in Economics after I read 'Why Nations Fail' & I got interested in investing by reading 'A Random Walk Down Wall Street'. If anyone wants to have a comfortable retirement, I highly recommend this book. My favorite PodCast is Dan Carlin's Hard Core History because I love history!
